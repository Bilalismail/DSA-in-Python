**Design a Zoo Management System**

Imagine you're tasked with designing a basic system to manage animals in a zoo. Here are the requirements:

1. Different types of animals should be supported (e.g., Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, etc.).
2. Each animal has a name, age, and health status.
3. The zoo has multiple enclosures, and each enclosure can contain multiple animals but only of the same type (e.g., an enclosure can contain only mammals or only birds, not a mix).
4. The system should be able to:
   - Add new enclosures.
   - Add new animals to a specific enclosure.
   - Retrieve a list of all animals in an enclosure.
   - Feed an animal, which improves its health status.
   - Check an animal's health status.

*Bonus:* Implement a feature where the system can list all animals in the zoo, grouped by their type.
